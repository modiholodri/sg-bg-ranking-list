### Rating Formula

If player 1 rated A wins a match up to N points against player 2 rated B, the rating of player 1 increases with W points and then the rating of player 2 drops with W points, where:

W = (1 − P) × S

Here, P is the probability of player 1 winning the match and S is the number of rating points at stake. These are given by:

P = 1 / (1 + 10^(-(A-B) × √N / 2000))

S = 4 × √N

- The winner's rating will increase by a number of points equal to the number of rating points at stake multiplied by the probability that the player involved would have lost the match.
- The loser's rating drops by a number of points equal to the number of rating points multiplied by the probability that the player involved would have won the match.

### Reporting Guidelines

Only the winner reports the result of a match.
A match counts only for the rating if it is a live played match (no money play or chouettes)
with both players agreeing beforehand that it will count for the rating.
